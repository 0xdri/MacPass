{"name":"MacPass","tagline":"A KeePass client for OS X","body":"There a lot of iOS KeePass tools around but a distinct lack of a good OS X Version.\r\nKeePass can be used via Mono on OS X but lacks vital functionality and feels sluggish.\r\n\r\nThis is an attempt to create an OS X port that should at least be able to read KeePass files.\r\n\r\n##Disclaimer\r\n\r\nThe Project is in heavy development and it's likely to take some time till it reaches a usable state.\r\nBeware that I'm going to shift things around so stuff is going to break. A lot.\r\n\r\n##Dowload\r\n\r\nI'm trying to upload new builds along the way for all of you that just want to take a quick look.\r\nAs stated in the disclaimer, this software cannot be considered safe for work in it's current development status.\r\nUse it with caution! Since I did start refactoring the KeePassLib there is even more potential broken code!\r\n\r\n[Older Version of MacPass at Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/yqgfwi7f8mnd747/NCQlJmg0f0) (build 1882 07/04/2013)\r\n\r\nAll [new Release](https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass/releases) are server from Github.\r\n\r\n##Known Issues\r\n\r\n* Undo/Redo get's messed up when the Trash (=RecylcleBin in KeePass terms) is enabled/used\r\n* Drag and Drop in Outline/Entry View broken\r\n\r\n##Help\r\n\r\nI'm in constant need of a full set of Databases with all possible keyfile/password and format combinations.\r\nIf you are able to provide databases with keyfiles (Hashed, Binary, XML) I would love to hear from you!\r\n\r\n##Requirement\r\n\r\nMacPass needs OS X 10.8 as a minimum OS version since it takes advantage of some of the enhancements in Autolayout in 10.8.\r\nIt might be possible to target 10.7 but with the upcomming 10.9 release, I think 10.8 is a feasable minimum.\r\n\r\n##Status\r\n\r\nTake a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass/wiki/Status)\r\n\r\n##Alternatives\r\n\r\nCurrently there is an alpha Version available of [KeePassX](http://www.keepassx.org).\r\nIt's Qt based KeePass manager, than can handle KeePass 1 and 2 containers rather nicely.\r\nCompared to running KeePass with Mono it very fast and remarkably stable for an alpha relaese.\r\nFeel free to give it a try. The biggest draw-back is it's inablity to create passwords via a wizzard.\r\n\r\n##What does it look like?\r\n\r\n![image](https://raw.github.com/mstarke/MacPass/master/Assets/Screenshots/MacPass.png)\r\n\r\nMore Screenshots in the [Wiki](https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass/wiki/Screenshots)\r\n\r\n##License\r\n\r\nMacPass KeePass compatible client for OS X\r\nCopyright (c) 2012-2013  Michael Starke, HicknHack Software GmbH\r\n  \r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
