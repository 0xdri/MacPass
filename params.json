{"name":"MacPass","tagline":"A KeePass client for OS X","body":"There a lot of iOS KeePass tools around but a distinct lack of a good OS X Version.\r\nKeePass can be used via Mono on OS X but lacks vital functionality and feels sluggish.\r\n\r\nMacPass is an attempt to create an OS X port of KeePass.\r\n\r\n##Disclaimer\r\nThe Project is in heavy development. Beware that I'm going to shift things around so stuff is going to break. A lot.\r\n\r\n##Dowload\r\n\r\nSince github now provides a release feature, I'm trying to upload binaries on all the tags I create along the way.\r\nUse it with caution, it's unfinished. Really!\r\n\r\nAll releases can be found at [Github](https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass/releases).\r\n\r\n##Known Major Issues\r\n\r\n* KDBX History is not supported\r\n* KDBX DeletedObjects are stripped on save. This will break synchronisation features!\r\n\r\n##System Requirement\r\n\r\nThe Minimum OS X Version for MacPass currently is 10.8 Mountain Lion.\r\nWith 10.9 Mavericks around the corner, I'm a bit hesitant to support 10.7 Lion.\r\n\r\n##Status\r\n\r\nThe Status can be found on the dedicated [Wiki page](https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass/wiki/Status).\r\n\r\n##What does it look like?\r\n\r\n![image](https://raw.github.com/mstarke/MacPass/master/Assets/Screenshots/MacPass.png)\r\n\r\nMore Screenshots in the [Wiki](https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass/wiki/Screenshots)\r\n\r\n##Alternatives\r\n\r\n[KeePassX](http://www.keepassx.org) is a Qt based KeePass port, than can read Databases Version 1 and 2 and write Version 2 containers rather nicely.\r\nIt's in active development, open source. Sadly there's only an older alpha binary release. It fully supports all database features.\r\n\r\n[KyPass Companion](http://www.kyuran.be/logiciels/kypass4mac/) is a native Cocoa port and offers KeePassHttp compatiblity.\r\nShould be able to read and write version 1 and 2 database. Is closed source and in early development. Beta releases have an expiry date. Not all database features are fully supported.\r\n\r\n[S3crets](http://s3crets.com/en/help/) native Cocoa Port with a different approach to displaying the database fully inside a tree.\r\nIs able to read and write version 1 and 2 databases. Not all database features are fully supported.\r\n\r\n## Help\r\n\r\nYou might get help in the IRC channel [#macpass](irc://irc.freenode.org/macpass) on [irc.freenode.org](irc://irc.freenode.org)\r\n\r\n##License\r\n\r\nMacPass KeePass compatible client for OS X\r\nCopyright (c) 2012-2013  Michael Starke, HicknHack Software GmbH\r\n  \r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
