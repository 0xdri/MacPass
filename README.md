MacPass
=======

There a lot of iOS KeePass Tools around but a distinct lack of a good OS X Version.
KeePass can be used as is via Mono on OS X but lacks vital Functionality.

This is a Attemtp to make create OS X port that should at least be able to read KeePass files.
Futher down the road there might be a complete port but. Maybe.

Vital work is used in this Port.
