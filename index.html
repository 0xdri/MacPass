          <p>There a lot of iOS KeePass tools around but a distinct lack of a good OS X Version.
KeePass can be used via Mono on OS X but lacks vital functionality and feels sluggish.</p>

<p>This is an attempt to create an OS X port that should at least be able to read KeePass files.</p>

<a name="disclaimer" class="anchor" href="#disclaimer"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>The Project is in heavy development and it's likely to take some time till it reaches a usable state.
Beware that I'm going to shift things around so stuff is going to break. A lot.</p>

<h2>
<a name="dowload" class="anchor" href="#dowload"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dowload</h2>

<p>I'm trying to upload new builds along the way for all of you that just want to take a quick look.
As stated in the disclaimer, this software cannot be considered safe for work in it's current development status.
Use it with caution! Since I did start refactoring the KeePassLib there is even more potential broken code!</p>

<a name="help" class="anchor" href="#help"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Help</h2>

<p>I'm in constant need of a full set of Databases with all possible keyfile/password and format combinations.
If you are able to provide databases with keyfiles (Hashed, Binary, XML) I would love to hear from you!</p>

<h2>
<a name="requirement" class="anchor" href="#requirement"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirement</h2>

<p>MacPass needs OS X 10.8 as a minimum OS version since it takes advantage of some of the enhancements in Autolayout in 10.8.
It might be possible to target 10.7 but with the upcomming 10.9 release, I think 10.8 is a feasable minimum.</p>

<h2>
<a name="status" class="anchor" href="#status"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Status</h2>

<p>Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/mstarke/MacPass/wiki/Status">Wiki</a></p>

<h2>
<a name="alternatives" class="anchor" href="#alternatives"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Alternatives</h2>

<p>Currently there is an alpha Version available of <a href="http://www.keepassx.org">KeePassX</a>.
It's Qt based KeePass manager, than can handle KeePass 1 and 2 containers rather nicely.
Compared to running KeePass with Mono it very fast and remarkably stable for an alpha relaese.
Feel free to give it a try. The biggest draw-back is it's inablity to create passwords via a wizzard.</p>
